# GroupLytics

A tool to extract non extructured data from Facebook Groups and process it for giving them meaning.

As always with scrapping, no matter if on the other side you'll have facebook or your local 
newspaper, be gentle with the server.

## Requirements

RSelenium, Purrr, Readr as of now.
Will probably use Dplyr, GGPlot, Magritr later on.

I'm still on an exploratory phase.
