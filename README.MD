# GroupLytics

A tool to extract non extructured data from Facebook Groups and process it for giving them meaning.

As always, with scrapping, no matter if on the other side you'll have facebook or your local 
newspaper, be gentle with the server.

## Requirements

RSelenium, TidyVerse (mainly Dplyr and Magrittr, as of now).

In the future I'll try to load only what I really need from TidyVerse. I'm still on an exploratory phase
